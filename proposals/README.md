# Proposals - Fully fledged theory crafting ideas

Basically the process for new features is:

1. You theory craft the idea / concept and get feedback
2. You hopefully design a PR implementing the idea for people to try out (can be messy/incomplete just meant as a prototype)
3. You then craft a proper proposal and get it approved and championed (either you or someone else will have to champion it - the champion builds the PR, multiple people can build it but that always gets messy with merging; in those cases split it up into concrete chunks that can be merged separately).
4. The final PR (or PRs) are made, submitted, tested, and finally merged

## Tracking for proposals

Will be on the project board!
