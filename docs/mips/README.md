# Mips Guide

This is a full MIPS guide meant to replace the specification guide that they ship...

It's intended for those that already understand MIPS and just need to have a reference for everything.

Currently we only support the following versions of MIPS;

- MIPS IV
  - [Instruction Set](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15740-f97/public/doc/mips-isa.pdf)
- 'SPIM'
  - Loosely based off [UNSW CSE's documentation](http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1521/17s2/docs/spim.php) but I'm definitely looking for a proper specification (just can't find an up to date one)
    - I don't want perhaps the newest SPIM I want a very simple version of it... otherwise it's basically just MIPS32
- MIPS32 v6

> The info here HAS to be accurate, if you find something that is potentially wrong please open a PR / issue so we can fix it ASAP.  Else it means the implementation is probably also wrong.
